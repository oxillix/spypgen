# spypgen - SpotiPy Playlist Generator

## Introduction

_spypgen_ makes it easy to create playlists in Spotify based on a combination of data from Spotify itself and 1001Tracklists. 

## Setup 

### Install dependencies

```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Get Credentials

In order to use spypgen, you need to have valid Spotify credentials. Most of these values are based on configurations obtained by creating and configuring a new client application using the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).

1. Visit [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and login to your Spotify account
1. Create a new client application using '_Create a Client ID_'
1. Configure the client application
    * Edit the settings and add a _redirect URI_ to http://localhost:PORT with a PORT of your choosing
    * Note the Client ID, Client Secret, and the port you chose
1. Use these values to create a JSON file of the following form:

    ```json
    {
      "user": "1255681820",
      "clientId": "d7b9a822782146c2b18cd79e1ccef473",
      "clientSecret": "e244999b618e48e38afbefd6a43d2e11",
      "redirectLocalHostPort": 8080
    }
    ```
    * _user_
        * Obtained by examining your profile in Spotify, and then hitting the ellipses > Share > Copy Spotify URI
    * _clientId_ / _clientSecret_
        * Obtained by visiting the and then creating a Client ID (see above)
    * _redirectLocalHostPort_
        * Needed in order for OAuth2 redirection while authentication with Spotify
        * Should match the port set as your localhost redirect (see above)

## Features

### Playlist Generation

Playlist generation using __spypgen__ can use two different workflows depending on the configurability desired.

#### Basic 

```shell
spypgen generate -c "credentials.json" -n "PlaylistName" -s "Artist 1,Artist2"
```

This generates a playlist with the given name with the default number of songs (5) for each of the artists provided in the comma-separated string based purely off of their popular Spotify songs. 

#### Advanced

```shell
spypgen generate -c "credentials.json" -p "playlist.json"   
```

This generates a playlist based on detailed configurations specified in a JSON file that appears as follows:

```json
{
    "name": "Anjunabeats LA Day 1",
    "artists": ["Mat Zo","Tinlicker","Grum","ALPHA 9","Jason Ross","Gabriel & Dresden"],
    "targetSongCounts":
    {
        "maxSongsPerArtist": 8,
        "recentSetListSongs": 5,
        "includeTopSpotifySongs": true
    },
    "setlists":
    {
        "numberSearched": 5,
        "inclusionThreshold": 0.5
    },
    "strictSearch": false
}
```

* _name_ - playlist name
* _artists_ - array of artists
* _targetSongCounts_
  * _maxSongsPerArtist_ - Maximum amount of songs included for each artist
  * _recentSetListSongs_ - Maximum amount of songs included for each artist from their recent sets, as listed on 1001Tracklists
  * _includeTopSpotifySongs - Whether to include top Spotify songs when an insufficient number of songs are found from the recent set lists
* _setlists_
  * _numberSearched_ - Number of recent setlists searched for each artist (i.e. n most recent set lists)
  * _inclusionThreshold_ - Barrier for inclusion of a recent set list song (
      * e.g. if set to 0.5, songs are only included if they are played in at least half of the artist's last n sets
* _strictSearch_ - when enabled, found artists are only included if they exactly match the case-insensitive search query 

#### Methodology of Playlist Generation

1. Authenticate with Spotify using OAuth2 and redirecting to a localhost port served by a simple HTTP listener in order to get an access code

    ```text

### Lineup Scraping

__spypgen__ also supports scraping a list of artists from an image of a lineup, which can then be utilized to create playlist using the _generate_ command. Unfortunately, this comes with the caveat that due to the nature of OCR, this is not 100% accurate, though results can be improved through manipulation of contrast on the image and other pre-processing. 

#### Basic

```shell
spypgen scrape lineup.png 
```

Scrapes a lineup and outputs a list of the found artists to the console with minor processing based on standard delimiters

#### With Validation

```shell
spypgen scrape lineup.png -c credentials.json -v
```

Leveraging existing Spotify credentials, __spypgen__ will query Spotify in order to validate each of the artists found. This allows for the correction of simple mistakes made during OCR.

```text

Found Rezz.
Searching for artist RINZEN...
Found Rinzen.

Found Matt Lange.
Searching for artist RJ VAN XETTEN...
Found Rj Van Xetten.
Searching for artist RL GRIME...

```

#### Further Customization

Other command line arguments can be used to further customize the lineup processing:

* -o (--output) - specify file for the output artists, which supports the following formats:
  * .csv
  * .json 
  * .txt
* -w (--whitelist_chars) - specified characters that will be recognized by the OCR as a component of an artist's name
  * default - 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&()
* -d (--delimiter_chars) - specified characters that will be recognized by the OCR as delimiters
  * default - \.,\-
  * Note: must be ','-separated
* --include_invalid - includes artists unsuccessfully validated using Spotify in the output so that they can be hand corrected
